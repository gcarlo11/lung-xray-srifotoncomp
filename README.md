# SRIFOTON UNSRI 2025: Machine Learning Competition Submission

This repository contains the Notebook used for the **SRIFOTON UNSRI 2025 Machine Learning Competition**. The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end solution for an image classification task, from data preparation and model training to final submission.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this competition was to classify images into one of five categories:
- Bacterial Pneumonia
- Corona Virus Disease
- Normal
- Tuberculosis
- Viral Pneumonia

The solution presented in this notebook utilizes **EfficientNetV2-M**, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, trained with advanced techniques to achieve high accuracy and robustness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Techniques Used

- **5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation:** The dataset was split into five folds, and a separate model was trained on each fold. This approach ensures the model is robust and not overfit to a single data split, providing a more reliable performance estimate.
- **Ensemble Learning:** The predictions from all five trained models were combined (ensembled) to produce the final predictions. Ensemble methods typically improve overall accuracy and stability.
- **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA):** To further boost the model's performance, predictions were made on multiple augmented versions of each test image (e.g., horizontal flips, affine transformations). The final prediction for each image was the average of the predictions on these augmented versions.
- **Pre-trained Backbone:** The EfficientNetV2-M model was used with pre-trained weights (`weights='DEFAULT'`), which helps in faster convergence and better performance on a limited dataset.
- **PyTorch and Timm:** The model was built and trained using the PyTorch deep learning framework and the `timm` library, a popular collection of pre-trained models.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The notebook is designed to be self-contained and run on a platform like Kaggle, where the data is pre-configured.

- `dream.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the full code for training and inference.
- `models/`: This directory is created by the notebook during execution to save the best model weights for each fold (e.g., `best_model_fold_0.pth`, `best_model_fold_1.pth`, etc.).
- `submission.csv`: The final prediction file generated by the notebook, ready for submission to the competition.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Notebook

This notebook is intended to be run in a Kaggle environment with GPU acceleration enabled.

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you are running it locally) or open the notebook on Kaggle.
2.  **Ensure the dataset is correctly linked:** The notebook expects the competition dataset to be mounted at `/kaggle/input/srifoton`.
3.  **Run all cells:** Execute the notebook from top to bottom. It will handle all steps automatically:
    - Installing necessary libraries (`!pip install timm`).
    - Loading and preparing the data.
    - Training the 5-fold cross-validation models.
    - Performing ensemble inference with TTA.
    - Generating the `submission.csv` file.

The training process for all 5 folds is computationally intensive and will take a considerable amount of time, even with a GPU. The progress is displayed using `tqdm` progress bars.
